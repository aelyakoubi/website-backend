This project employs robust security measures, including:

Sentry: for real-time error and performance monitoring.

HTTPS: for production environment to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

Helmet: to secure HTTP headers, mitigating XSS, content sniffing, and clickjacking.

Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection: to prevent abusive requests.

CORS: configured per environment to safeguard against CSRF attacks.

Bcrypt en Salting: for secure password hashing, utilizing a salt to enhance security.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT): for secure user authentication.

AUTH_SECRET_KEY: safe for production use of 512 bits long, which is equivalent to 64 bytes or 128 hex characters (as each hex character represents 4 bits).

Input Validation & Sanitization: to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

Log Rotation with DailyRotateFile: for efficient log management, rotating and compressing logs to prevent excessive disk usage and ensure long-term retention without impacting performance.
